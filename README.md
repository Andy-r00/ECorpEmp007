## <u>Summary</u>

Welcome to my README called Five-Nine (referencing the "5/9" zero-day in Mr Robot). This repository is specifically for Windows based systems.

### Windows Based Scripts

### Compare-File-Script.ps1

Utilises the Compare Command in PowerShell, into a script. By allowing comparison of multiple files, in this case `$fileA` & `$fileB`.
To add more files just add another line, `$fileC` through `Z`, and the following file path to compare file for comparison.

**Note:**
*This was utilised and practiced on a Malware Triage VM utilising Windows 10 H*
